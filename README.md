### Main Files and Folders:
- **`index.js`**: The entry point of the backend server.
- **`config/`**: Configuration settings for database, authentication, and environment variables.
- **`controllers/`**: Contains the logic to handle API requests, such as user and nutrition data.
- **`middleware/`**: Includes middlewares for authentication and error handling.
- **`models/`**: Contains the schema definitions for MongoDB, handling users, food data, and nutritional information.
- **`routes/`**: Defines all the API endpoints used by the frontend to interact with the backend.
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions, such as error handlers and other helper functions.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is developed using React and is designed to provide a seamless user experience for tracking nutrition and diabetes management.

### Main Files and Folders:
- **`src/`**: Contains the main React components and the application logic.
- **`assets/`**: Stores images, fonts, and other static files.
- **`desktop/`**: Specific design and logic for the desktop version of the app.

### Key Components:
- **Header**: Contains navigation links and user authentication status.
- **NutritionTracker**: Allows users to input their daily food intake and track their progress.
- **FoodSearch**: Lets users search for food items and retrieve nutritional information.
- **UserProfile**: Displays user information and allows for updating account details.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to handle API requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, food items, and nutritional information.

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: For managing the application's state.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.

## Usage

Once the backend and frontend are running, you can access the app locally through the default development server (usually `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend). Users can sign up, log in, search for food items, and track their nutrition intake.

### Available API Routes:

- **`/api/users`**: Handles user authentication and profile management.
- **`/api/foods`**: Provides nutritional information for food items.
- **`/api/nutrition`**: Manages the user's nutritional tracking.
